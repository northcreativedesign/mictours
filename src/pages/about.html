          <p>We are united through our heritage and our culture.</p>
          <p>For nearly 15 years we have been inviting our visitors to come learn about Metlakatla, Alaska- The only federally recognized reserve in the state of Alaska.</p>
          <h3>“</h3><h3>Hasagu dm adaawgm</h3><h3>da kwan</h3>
          <p>Simply put- we have a story to tell. It is our job to tell that story as accurately and compellingly as possible. The word of our people and our past has lived based from oral language and traditional story-telling. This demonstrates how important it is to not only focus on how you tell a story, but the story accuracy is equally crucial.</p>
          <p>We educate all people who visit our island and we have the distinct ability of doing so in a memborable way. Our goal is to have our guests leave here with an experience that is dynamic and multi-faceted.</p>
